# Laserleikkuri

## Description

This project was written with (or rather *by*) copilot while trying it out for the first time. It fetches [Oodi's laser cutter](https://varaamo.hel.fi/resources/axwzr3i57yba) opening times and reservations, 
and prints out the available times for the following month to the console.
